In markdown, include the following:

* A description of the background and the questions you hope to address 
* A description of the data source and three variables you think will be useful 
* A description of the one analysis approach you will take 

This data is from Urban Ministries, which focuses on lowering the community's rate of homelessness by providing food, shelter and other resources. The data includes variables such as number of people in the family for which food was provided, money provided to clients, etc. I would like to focus my project 1 on trends or correlations, such as do individuals with larger families (food provided for) tend to return to UM more often? Or are individuals with babies (diapers) more likely to buy bus tickets to visit than indivudals without need of diapers (assume, no babies). This information would be likely useful for UM to analyze who is more likely to make more effort to come find them. 

Although these are generic question, I would like to focus on these types of simple comparisons (specifically, just one comparison, although I havent decided which one yet). Thus, variables of interst include date, Client file number, merge, and bus ticket/diapers/food provided for, etc. 

One analysis approach to analyze associations I might take is Fisher's Exact test, due to large missing values, so that cell counts might be small.
