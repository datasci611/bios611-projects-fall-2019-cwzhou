This data is from Urban Ministries of Durham (UMD), which focuses on lowering the community's rate of homelessness by providing food, shelter and other resources. Their website is here: http://www.umdurham.org/.

The data includes variables such as number of people in the family for which food was provided, how many pounds of food taken from the food pantry per day, and more. A full list of variables can be found here: https://github.com/biodatascience/datasci611/blob/gh-pages/data/project1_2019/UMD_Services_Provided_metadata_20190719.tsv.

For this project, I created an interactive app that allows the target audience to interact with the UMD data and explore using Shiny dashboard. This interactive format allows the viewer to explore the UMD data on their own. My audience is for volunteers at UMD and anyone curious about UMD trends over time outside of UMD. Thus, this app is not statistically heavy and has an interactive, easy to understand layout.

At the end, the user will have a better idea of what the UMD data looks like and how often clients tend to visit.
