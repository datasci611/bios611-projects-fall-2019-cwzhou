This data is from Urban Ministries of Durham (UMD), which focuses on lowering the community's rate of homelessness by providing food, shelter and other resources. Their website is here: http://www.umdurham.org/.

The data includes variables such as number of people in the family for which food was provided, how many pounds of food taken from the food pantry per day, and more. A full list of variables can be found here: https://github.com/biodatascience/datasci611/blob/gh-pages/data/project1_2019/UMD_Services_Provided_metadata_20190719.tsv.

For this project, I hope to analyze trends at UMD over time, whether between individuals or within subgroups or clusters. The goal is to use a Shiny dashboard, which will have an interactive format to allow the viewer to explore the UMD data on their own. My audience is for volunteers at UMD and anyone curious about UMD trends over time outside of UMD. Thus, it will not be statistically heavy and will have more of an interactive, easy to understand layout.

At the end, the user will have a better idea of UMD trends.
